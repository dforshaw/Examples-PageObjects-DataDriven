Examples-PageObjects-DataDriven
===============================

Test framework examples I've built with Selenium Web Driver &amp; Junit that are data-driven &amp; use the Page Objects pattern.

    -- (a) I started with the CSV import example from chapter 4 of the Selenium Testing Tools Cookbook.
       (b) Next I isolated the data-driven part into its own utility file.
       (c) Finally I refactored the code to pull out the test procedure and design the page objects.
